# Chess-clock-with-Yakindu
State base modelling
The task is to design the controller of a chess clock based on the
specification below using Yakindu.


## Getting Started

The task of the chess clock is to specify the time to think for the participants.
Both players (White and Black) have a given amount of time to think, wich the
chess clock displays. The time of the current player constantly decreases. If the
time runs out, the player loses and the clock beeps to indicate the termination of
the game due to timeout. If the current player moves in time, the player should
press the approriate button. As a result the decreasing stops and (depending on
the gameâ€™s setup) the time increases by a certain amout of reward time and the
other player comes instantly. The player can use the remaining time (increased
with reward time) to think in the next turn.
